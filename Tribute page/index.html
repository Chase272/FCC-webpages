        <p>
          Cobain was born at Grays Harbor Hospital in Aberdeen, Washington on
          February 20, 1967.When Cobain was nine years old, his parents
          divorced. He later said the divorce had a profound effect on his
          life, while his mother noted that his personality changed
          dramatically; Cobain became defiant and withdrawn.
         His father and Westeby took him to a therapist, who concluded that he would benefit from a single family. While living with the born-again Christian family of his friend Jesse Reed, he became a devout Christian and regularly attended church services. He later renounced Christianity, engaging in what was described as "anti-God" rants. The song "Lithium" is about his experience while living with the Reed family. Religion remained an important part of his personal life and beliefs.

              Nirvana was an American rock band formed in Aberdeen, Washington in
          1987. Founded by lead singer and guitarist Kurt Cobain and bassist
          Krist Novoselic, the band went through a succession of drummers before
          recruiting Dave Grohl in 1990. Nirvana's success popularized
          alternative rock. Cobain immersed himself in artistic projects
          throughout his life, as much so as he did in songwriting. The
          sentiments of his art work followed the same subjects of his lyrics,
          often expressed through a dark and macabre sense of humor. Noted were
          his fascination with physiology, his own rare medical conditions, and
          the human anatomy.

    On April 8 1994, Cobain's body was discovered at his Lake Washington Boulevard home by electrician Gary Smith,[79] who had arrived to install a security system. Apart from a small amount of blood coming out of Cobain's ear, the electrician reported seeing no visible signs of trauma and initially believed that Cobain was asleep until he saw the shotgun pointing at his chin. A suicide note was found, addressed to Cobain's childhood imaginary friend Boddah, that stated that Cobain had not "felt the excitement of listening to as well as creating music, along with really writing ... for too many years now".

<p id="quote">"Genius is a weird and inappropriate word, and hard work is underrated, but Kurt Cobain had a distinct and personal take on the world, and generally, when someone strikes a chord with his audience, thatâ€™s what people respond to."
