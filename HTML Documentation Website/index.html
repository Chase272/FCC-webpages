        <p>
          HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is not a programming language. It is
          a markup language that tells web browsers how to structure the web
          pages you visit. It can be as complicated or as simple as the web
          developer wants it to be. HTML consists of a series of elements, which
          you use to enclose, wrap, or mark up different parts of content to
          make it appear or act in a certain way. The enclosing tags can make
          content into a hyperlink to connect to another page, italicize words,
          and so on.
        </p>
        <p> The standard layout of an <code>HTML</code> may look as follows
            <div class="html-code">
            <pre class="brush: html notranslate"><code><span class="token doctype"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;!</span><span class="token doctype-tag">DOCTYPE</span> <span class="token name">html</span><span class="token punctuation">&gt;</span></span>
                <span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;</span>html</span><span class="token punctuation">&gt;</span></span>
                  <span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;</span>head</span><span class="token punctuation">&gt;</span></span>
                    <span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;</span>meta</span> <span class="token attr-name">charset</span><span class="token attr-value"><span class="token punctuation attr-equals">=</span><span class="token punctuation">"</span>utf-8<span class="token punctuation">"</span></span><span class="token punctuation">&gt;</span></span>
                    <span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;</span>title</span><span class="token punctuation">&gt;</span></span>My test page<span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;/</span>title</span><span class="token punctuation">&gt;</span></span>
                  <span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;/</span>head</span><span class="token punctuation">&gt;</span></span>
                  <span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;</span>body</span><span class="token punctuation">&gt;</span></span>
                    <span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;</span>p</span><span class="token punctuation">&gt;</span></span>This is my page<span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;/</span>p</span><span class="token punctuation">&gt;</span></span>
                  <span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;/</span>body</span><span class="token punctuation">&gt;</span></span>

        <header><h2>The Head</h2></header>
        <p>The HTML head is the contents of the <code> < head > </code> element — unlike the contents of the <code>< body></code> element (which are displayed on the page when loaded in a browser), the head's content is not displayed on the page. Instead, the head's job is to contain metadata about the document.In larger pages however, the head can get quite full. Try going to some of your favorite websites and use the developer tools to check out their head contents. Our aim here is not to show you how to use everything that can possibly be put in the head, but rather to teach you how to use the major elements that you'll want to include in the head, and give you some familiarity. Let's get started.</p>
  <p>Metadata is data that describes data, and HTML has an "official" way of adding metadata to a document — the <meta> element. Of course, the other stuff we are talking about in this article could also be thought of as metadata too. There are a lot of different types of <meta> elements that can be included in your page's <head>, but we won't try to explain them all at this stage, as it would just get too confusing. Instead, we'll explain a few things that you might commonly see, just to give you an idea.</p>    
    </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Adding_a_title">
        <header><h2>Adding a title</h2></header>
        <p>We've already seen the <code>title</code>  element in action — this can be used to add a title to the document. This however can get confused with the <code>< h1></code> element, which is used to add a top level heading to your body content — this is also sometimes referred to as the page title. But they are different things!
        </p>
            <ul>
           <li>The <code>< h1 > </code>element appears on the page when loaded in the browser — generally this should be used once per page, to mark up the title of your page content (the story title, or news headline, or whatever is appropriate to your usage.)</li> 
           <li>The  <code>< title></code> element is metadata that represents the title of the overall HTML document (not the document's content.)</li> 
</ul>
        </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Website_structure">
        <header><h2>Website Structure</h2></header>

        
        <p>Webpages can and will look pretty different from one another, but they all tend to share similar standard components, unless the page is displaying a fullscreen video or game, is part of some kind of art project, or is just badly structured:</p>
      <ul class="format">
          <li>
        <b>Header</b>
      <p>Usually a big strip across the top with a big heading, logo, and perhaps a tagline. This usually stays the same from one webpage to another.</p>
   </li>
   <li>
      <b>Navigation bar</b>
    <p>Links to the site's main sections; usually represented by menu buttons, links, or tabs. Like the header, this content usually remains consistent from one webpage to another — having inconsistent navigation on your website will just lead to confused, frustrated users. Many web designers consider the navigation bar to be part of the header rather than an individual component, but that's not a requirement; in fact, some also argue that having the two separate is better for accessibility, as screen readers can read the two features better if they are separate.</p>
      </li>
    <li>
    <b>Main content</b>
      <p>A big area in the center that contains most of the unique content of a given webpage, for example, the video you want to watch, or the main story you're reading, or the map you want to view, or the news headlines, etc. This is the one part of the website that definitely will vary from page to page!</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Sidebar</b>
    <p>Some peripheral info, links, quotes, ads, etc. Usually, this is contextual to what is contained in the main content (for example on a news article page, the sidebar might contain the author's bio, or links to related articles) but there are also cases where you'll find some recurring elements like a secondary navigation system.</p>
    </li>
   <li>
    <b>Footer</b>
    <p>A strip across the bottom of the page that generally contains fine print, copyright notices, or contact info. It's a place to put common information (like the header) but usually, that information is not critical or secondary to the website itself. The footer is also sometimes used for SEO purposes, by providing links for quick access to popular content.</p>
</li> 
</ul>
    </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="HTML_Debugging">
        <header><h2>HTML Debugging</h2></header>
        <p>HTML is not as complicated to understand as Rust. HTML is not compiled into a different form before the browser parses it and shows the result (it is interpreted, not compiled). And HTML's element syntax is arguably a lot easier to understand than a "real programming language" like Rust, JavaScript, or Python. The way that browsers parse HTML is a lot more permissive than how programming languages are run, which is both a good and a bad thing.</p>
        
        <ul>
            <h3>Type of errors</h3>
            <li><p> <b>Syntax errors:</b>  These are spelling or punctuation errors in your code that actually cause the program not to run, like the Rust error shown above. These are usually easy to fix as long as you are familiar with the language's syntax and know what the error messages mean.</p></li>
        <li><p><b>Logic errors:</b>  These are errors where the syntax is actually correct, but the code is not what you intended it to be, meaning that the program runs incorrectly. These are often harder to fix than syntax errors, as there isn't an error message to direct you to the source of the error.</p></li>
        </ul>
      </section>
     <section class="main-section" id="HTML_Validation">
         <header><h2>HTML Validation</h2></header>
         <p>So you can see from the above example that you really want to make sure your HTML is well-formed! But how? In a small example like the one seen above, it is easy to search through the lines and find the errors, but what about a huge, complex HTML document?</p>
     <p>The best strategy is to start by running your HTML page through the Markup Validation Service — created and maintained by the W3C, the organization that looks after the specifications that define HTML, CSS, and other web technologies. This webpage takes an HTML document as an input, goes through it, and gives you a report to tell you what is wrong with your HTML.</p>
